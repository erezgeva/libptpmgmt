libptpmgmt (2.0) trixie; urgency=medium

  * Add the first version of the Clock Manager
    A framework for controlling and monitoring network time synchronization
    on the local platform.
  * Rewrite PHC control tool in Go.
    Implement linuxptp 'phc_ctl' using the Go wrapper library.
  * Replace 'select' with 'poll'.
  * Improve proc functions
    - base integer proc functions
    - Managment TLVs wuth vector
  * HMAC add load and unload  to improve safe multi-threads
    Control the load and unload from the hmac module,
    with uses mutex for multi-threads protection.
    Use macros for C wrapper function in source module.

  * Rename proc.h, sig.h to mngTlvs.h, sigTlvs.h.
  * Add support for extended format of L1_SYNC TLV
  * More Improvements that breaks ABI backwards-compatible
  * Improve message to JSON string creating.
    - Use structure to hold the string.
    - comply to other structures way.
  * Improve C dispatcher and add C builder.
    - Remove all direct functions and use methods instead.
    - Use the new TLV memory for builder.
    - Move TLVs callbacks into a separate structures.
    - call virtual functions from inline function,
      so we compile it in the application and

    - Add copy and move to MANAGEMENT_t.
    - Any class that uses unique pointer should
     implement copy and move constructors explicitly.
    - MessageSigTlvs need explicit,
      as the last Signalling flag can save copying
      or move of the Signalling TLVs list.
    - Repair TLVs structure by converting

  * tlv_mem: use allocations vector with a class releasing the memory
    on destructor, similar to unique_ptr.
  * Add Binary move constructor.
  * Binary assign: protect against self assign.
  * If we use copy constructor,
     we should also add a move constructor.
  * Add getTlv() to MessageSigTlvs.
  * Order MessageSigTlv code in place.
  * Add a test for coping a management TLV.
    Ensure the copy works in C++.
  * Rebase signalling TLVs list in message.
    Add range based loop support.
  * JSON Parser: add to string.
    Add more tests.
    Replace find with equal_range.
  * Improve TLV C to C++ and via versa.
  * Add Iterator to JSON Array class.
  * Add missing test for sockets initialisation state.
  * Delete without checking  for null.
  * Remove inline methods of JSON parser.
  * Mark local functions of message module as inline.
  * Improve handling of reallocation in TLV memory.
  * Remove testing of reallocation with ASAN test.
    As it fail to probe it correctly.
  * Add C TLV structure to track memory allocations.
  * Improve process of TLVs.

    - Add EXTERNAL_GRANDMASTER_PROPERTIES_NP management
      message to get and set the new external grandmasterIdentity
      and stepsRemoved variables of the clock.
    - Together with the GRANDMASTER_SETTINGS_NP message all
      grandmaster-specific values in announce messages can be now set.
    - Add PORT_CORRECTIONS_NP management message
      to get and set the port egressLatency,
      ingressLatency and delayAsymmetry variables.
      This enables an external process to compensate for changes
      in the network and timestamping asymmetries while ptp4l is running.
  * A fix in JSON to message unit test.
  * Add libchrony probing.
  * Fix go wrapper make file.

    - Add C++ classes and native classes in each script language.
    - Call Message.clearData() in destructor of MessageBuilder.
    - Lua use C++ MessageBuilder object to ensure
      calling Message.clearData(), as Lua native do not use destructors.
    - Beside Lua using C++ MessageBuilder, C++ classes are not wrapped by Swig!
    - Use abstract classes in PHP
    - MessageDispatcher::callHadler() call virtual noTlvCallBack()
      if the TLV call back is not inherited.

libptpmgmt (0.8) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Fix cross compilation in make-file.
    install target should install and not build.
  * Remove end.h err.h headers from Doxygen and development package.
  * Properly read all dependencies files in make-file.
  * Socket class
    - Default socket file for non-root users.
      Prefer system run folder per user over home directory.
    - Improve socket closing.
  * From JSON to message support
    - Create separate libraries to process JSON into message.
      Each of them depends on a JSON library.
      Load one of them on run time when user try to process a JSON.
      This way we keep the main library loading
       with standard libraries only.
    - Add function to load a specific jsonFrom library.
    - Static library uses only one JSON library.
        User will need to link with this JSON library
        once the user application needs the functionality.
  * Add support for Options class in scripts
    - Add SWIG support to call argc-argv using C main style from scripts.
    - Add Lua, Perl, Tcl and PHP SWIG argcargv.i
      that are missing from the SWIG projecy.
      These argcargv.i are plan for the SWIG project.
    - Use the Options class in testing scripts.
    - Change the string types in Pmc_option structure to C++.
    - Add the Option and Init class to SWIG build.
  * Create a new header with types used by the message class.
  * Reduce the number of C macros and use project style for the reset
    - As macros could conflict with other projects or headers.
      We use C++, so we can define them in enumerators as possible,
      use project style, to reduce conflicts, and move macros to module,
      and reduce the number of public macros.
    - Use project macro name style in SWIG definition file.
    - Remove macros from ids header.
    - Rename 'caseXXX' macros. But leave 'A' unchanged for now.
    - Move first and last IDs to the new 'types' header, in the enumerator.
      So, they are not macros anymore.
    - Move shortcut macro of allowed action for
      a management ID to the message module. No reason to have them public.
    - Replace vector macros with template functions.
    - Move macros from message header to process module.
      No reason to have them public.
    - We left:
      14 headers with protection macros follow the __PTPMGMT_XXX_H format.
      3 macros with library version on compilation, LIBPTPMGMT_VER...
      3 macros for 48 bits limit INT48_XXX, follow the standard.
      5 _ptpmCaseXX macros and 'A' macro used internally with the ids.h header.
      _ptpmParseFunc macro used internally in the message class.
  * Improve documentation in headers.
  * Add functions for using the allowSigTlvs map in MsgParams.
    So, scripts can not access the map.
