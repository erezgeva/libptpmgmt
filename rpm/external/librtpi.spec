Summary:        The Real-Time Priority Inheritance Library
%description
realtime capable pthread locking primitives (lib)
The Real-Time Priority Inheritance Library (%{name}) is
intended to bridge the gap between the glibc pthread
implementation and a functionally correct priority inheritance
for pthread locking primitives, such as pthread_mutex and
pthread_condvar. Specifically, priority based wakeup is required
for correct operation, in  contrast to the more time-based
ordered wakeup groups in the glibc pthread condvar implementation.
This package contains the runtime library.
